# Milestone1
## Specifications
You met the majority of the required specifications laid out in the documentation. The only small errors were: You did not include /vendor in your .gitignore file (vendor needs to be added to your gitignore ASAP), and you also need to move the images directory to /public_html/documentation. The documentation should be self contained in its directory so unintended side effects are not possible when your developing the site.
## Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone1. Your documentation lays out a clear vision of what you hope to accomplish, and your goals fit into the scope of the project.

# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, Git history, and content are superb. This is the quality of work I would expect out of a jr developer working underneath me. The road map you laid out for yourself in Milestone2a will be extremely beneficial when you start development.
### Wireframes
Your Wireframes are clear and in-depth. With a quick glance I am able to tell what you hope to accomplish and have a clear vision of what your website will look like. The Mobile and Desktop wireframes match and are clearly of the same site(which should translate nicely bootstrap4). The only question I have from the wireframes is what the pie graph in the about me section for the mobile site supposed to be.
### Content Strategy
The Content Strategy is clear and complements your wireframes nicely. I have a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish.
## Design Tips
Do you really want to hide  the image carousel in the mobile view? An image carousel is easy to accomplish for mobile. If you decide to do the image gallery in the mobile view I recommend writing media query to check screen size and display the carousel or gallery based off a medium breakpoint. For the actual carousel I recommend using FancyBox3.

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
