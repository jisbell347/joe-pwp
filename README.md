Personal Website Project
## Specifications
You met the majority of the required specifications laid out in the documentation. The only small errors were: You did not include /vendor in your .gitignore file (vendor needs to be added to your gitignore ASAP), and you also need to move the images directory to /public_html/documentation. The documentation should be self contained in its directory so unintended side effects are not possible when your developing the site.
## Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone1. Your documentation lays out a clear vision of what you hope to accomplish, and your goals fit into the scope of the project.
